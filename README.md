# GitAIReader – AI-Powered GitHub Code Assistant using Endee


## 📌 Project Overview

##  Project Overview

GitAIReader is an **AI-powered GitHub repository analysis tool** that enables users to ask **natural language questions about any public GitHub codebase**.  
The system uses **vector embeddings, hybrid search, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to understand source code and provide accurate, contextual answers.

At its core, the project uses **Endee as the vector database**, with a **robust local fallback mode** to ensure the application works even if the Endee server is unavailable.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a real-world **AI/ML project using vector search**
- Use **Endee** as the primary vector database
- Implement **Semantic Search + Hybrid Search + RAG**
- Analyze GitHub repositories programmatically
- Provide a clean, user-friendly interface using Streamlit
- Host the complete project on GitHub with proper documentation

---

## 🚀 Use Case Implemented
### ✅ AI-Powered Code Understanding (Semantic Search & RAG)

**What this application does:**
- Accepts a GitHub repository URL
- Clones the repository locally
- Splits code into meaningful chunks
- Generates vector embeddings
- Stores embeddings in **Endee**
- Retrieves relevant code using:
  - Vector similarity search
  - BM25 keyword search (hybrid search)
  - Cross-encoder reranking
- Uses a local LLM (via Ollama) to generate accurate answers

**Example questions:**
- "What does this repository do?"
- "Explain this file in simple terms"
- "Where is authentication handled?"
- "Why is this code used?"

---

## 🧠 Endee Vector Database Integration
Endee is used as the **core vector storage layer** for this project.

- Stores embeddings for all code chunks
- Enables fast vector similarity search
- Automatically switches to **local in-memory fallback mode** if:
  - Endee server is not running
  - Connection to `localhost:8080` fails
- Ensures reliability during local development

## 🧩 System Architecture / Workflow

1. User enters a GitHub repository URL
2. Repository is cloned locally
3. Code files are scanned and filtered by extension
4. Files are split into overlapping chunks
5. Embeddings are generated
6. Embeddings are stored in Endee
7. User query is embedded
8. Hybrid search is performed:
   - Vector search (Endee)
   - Keyword search (BM25)
9. Results are reranked using a cross-encoder
10. Top results are passed to the LLM
11. Final response is streamed to the UI

# Endee: High-Performance Open Source Vector Database

**Endee (nD)** is a specialized, high-performance vector database built for speed and efficiency. This guide covers supported platforms, dependency requirements, and detailed build instructions using both our automated installer and manual CMake configuration.

there are 3 ways to build and run endee:
1. quick installation and run using install.sh and run.sh scripts
2. manual build using cmake
3. using docker

also you can run endee using docker from docker hub without building it locally. refer to section 4 for more details.

## ▶️ Running the Project in VS Code

### 🔹 Step 1: Open Project in VS Code
1. Open VS Code
2. Click **File** → **Open Folder**
3. Navigate to and select the `GitAicode_Reader` folder

### 🔹 Step 2: Open Terminal in VS Code
Choose any method:
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Ctrl + `` (backtick)
- **Menu**: Click **Terminal** → **New Terminal**
- **Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`, type "Create New Terminal", press Enter

### 🔹 Step 3: Run the Application

- ✓ Check for Ollama
- ✓ Launch the Streamlit app

**Wait for the message:** `Local URL: http://localhost:8501`

#### 🔹 Option B: Manual Setup
If the automated script fails, run these commands one by one in the VS Code terminal:

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 2. Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the application
streamlit run app_files/app.py
```

*Note: You should see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt after activation*

### 🔹 Step 4: Open in Browser

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting in VS Code

### 🔴 "Connection refused" for localhost:8080
**This is normal and safe to ignore!**
- The app tries to connect to the Endee vector database server
- It automatically falls back to local in-memory storage
- Your application will work perfectly fine

### 🔴 "Ollama not found"
**Solution:**
1. Ensure Ollama is installed from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/)
2. Verify it's running: `ollama list`
3. Download the model: `ollama run qwen2.5:3b`
4. Keep Ollama running in the background

### 🔴 "ModuleNotFoundError" or "streamlit is not recognized"
**Solution:**
1. Activate the virtual environment: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
2. Look for `(venv)` at the start of your terminal prompt
3. Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Alternative: `python -m streamlit run app_files/app.py`

### 🔴 "Python is not recognized"
**Solution:**
1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Check **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation
3. Restart VS Code
4. Verify: `python --version`

### 🔴 Port 8501 already in use
**Solution:**
- Streamlit will use the next available port (8502, 8503, etc.)
- Check terminal output for the actual URL
- Or stop existing process: Press `Ctrl + C`

### 🔴 Slow AI responses
**Solution:**
- Use smaller models like `qwen2.5:3b` (recommended)
- Avoid large models like `llama2:70b`

### 🔴 Virtual environment activation issues
**Solution:**
- If `.\venv\Scripts\activate` doesn't work, try:
  - PowerShell: `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
  - Command Prompt: `.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
- Or use the automated script: `.\start.bat`

---

## 🔄 Stopping the Application

To stop Streamlit in VS Code:
- Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal
- Or close the terminal window
- Or click the trash icon in the terminal panel

### Run the Container

The container exposes port `8080` and stores data in `/data` inside container. You should persist this data using a docker volume.

```bash
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v endee-data:/data \
  -e NDD_AUTH_TOKEN="your_secure_token" \
  --name endee-server \
  endee-oss:latest
```

leave `NDD_AUTH_TOKEN` empty or remove it to run endee without authentication.

### Alternatively: Docker Compose

You can also use `docker-compose` to run the service.

1. Start the container:
=======
### One-Time Ollama Setup
1. Open a terminal (Windows: Search "cmd" or "PowerShell")
2. Download the AI model:
   ```bash
   ollama run qwen2.5:3b
   ```
3. Wait for download, then type `/bye` to exit
4. Keep Ollama running in the background
