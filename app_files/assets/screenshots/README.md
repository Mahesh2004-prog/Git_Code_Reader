# Quick Screenshot Setup

## 📋 What I've Done:

✅ Created directory: `app_files/assets/screenshots/`
✅ Added screenshots section to README.md (lines 205-218)
✅ Configured three screenshot placeholders:
   - main_interface.png
   - repo_analysis.png
   - file_analysis.png

## 🎯 What You Need to Do:

Based on the screenshots you shared, save them as follows:

### Screenshot 1: main_interface.png
- The first image showing the clean interface with:
  - "GitHub Code Assistant" header
  - GitHub Repository URL input field
  - "Analyze Repo" button
  - Setup sidebar with Ollama Model Name (qwen2.5-3b)
  - Speed Tips section

### Screenshot 2: repo_analysis.png
- The second image showing:
  - Repository analysis for "dexter" project
  - AI explanation: "What does this repository do?"
  - Detailed description with getFilings function
  - Repository Map sidebar
  - Download section
  - File browser (AGENTS.md, README.md, etc.)

### Screenshot 3: file_analysis.png
- The third image showing:
  - README.md file analysis
  - "Human Readable Information" section
  - "Function of this File" section
  - Detailed explanation of the Dexter project

## 💾 How to Save:

1. Take your three screenshots (or use the ones you already have)
2. Save them to: `C:\Users\mahes\GitAicode_Reader\app_files\assets\screenshots\`
3. Name them exactly as:
   - `main_interface.png`
   - `repo_analysis.png`
   - `file_analysis.png`

## ✅ Done!

Once you save the images, the README.md will automatically display them with the captions I've added.

The README is already configured and ready to display your screenshots!
